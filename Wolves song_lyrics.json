"5 ContributorsRaised By Wolves Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou got my letter, you read it twice\nShort breaths, long sighs\nMight be a liar, might be a drunk\nBut I forgive you for your giving up\nFor your giving up\n\n[Chorus]\nIt doesn't matter, my life was shattered\nAnd my heart's got holes\nYou left a child out in the wild\nAnd I was raised by wolves\nI was raised by wolves, ah-ooh\nI was raised by wolves, ah-ooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, we would dig for scraps out in the cold\nAfter you left to go and try and find your pot of gold\nMy teeth got sharper, my skin got tough\nSo I forgive you for your giving up\nFor your giving up\n\n[Chorus]\nIt doesn't matter, my life was shattered\nAnd my heart's got holes\nYou left a child out in the wild\nAnd I was raised by wolves\nI was raised by wolves, ah-ooh\nI was raised by wolves, ah-ooh\n(Yeah)\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nYeah, when you left and said goodbye\nUnder the moonlight, we had to learn to stay alive\nIn the wild\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou got my letter, read it twice\nShort breaths, long sighs\nMight be a liar, might be a drunk\nBut I forgive you, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nIt doesn't matter, my life was shattered\nAnd my heart's got holes\nYou left a child out in the wild\nAnd I was raised by wolves\nI was raised by wolves, ah-ooh\nI was raised by wolves, ah-ooh\nI was raised by wolves, ah-ooh\nI was raised by wolves (Yeah), ah-oohEmbed"
